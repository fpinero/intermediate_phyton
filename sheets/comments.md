# Comments

Learn why comments are important and how to make them in Python.

This article will go over the importance of comments and different ways to make them.
* What Are Comments?

In Python, comments are made with # to explain code at various points in the code. Comments are not executed as code and are used for documentation. There are two types of comments: inline comments and block comments.
Inline Comments

* Inline comments should be used when you have a short comment that you would like to include after a line of code.

````
minutes = seconds / 60  # calculating minutes from seconds
````
* Block Comments

Block comments are used when you have multiple lines of comments that youâ€™d like to include with your code. Unlike most languages that have special syntax for multiple lines of comments, Python requires # on consecutive single lines.
````
def calculate_minutes(seconds):
   # This function calculates the time in minutes 
   # from given seconds.
   minutes = seconds / 60
   return minutes
````
