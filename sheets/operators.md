# Operators

Learn about different types of operators in Python.

Operators are used to perform operations on variables in Python. We will cover the following operators in this article:

*    Arithmetic Operators
*    Assignment Operators
*    Comparison Operators
*    Logical Operators

** Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical variables such as int or float. See the table for the common arithmetic operators used in Python:

| Operator 	 | Name of Operation 	 | Example 	  |                                                       Description |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| +          | Addition | 	x + y     |                                                         	x plus y |
| -          |	Subtraction| 	x - y     |                                                        	x minus y |
| *          |	Multiplication| 	x * y     |                                                	x multiplied by y |
| **         | 	Exponentiation|  	x ** y 	 |                                        x raised to the power of y |
| /          |Division| 	x / y          |                                                   	x divided by y | 
| //         | 	Floor Division| 	x // y    |                                	x divided by y, returning integer |
| %          |	Modulo| 	x % y     |                                  	The remainder of x divided by y | 

See examples of these operators below:
````
x = 4
y = 3
 
x + y  # returns 7
x - y  # returns 1
x * y  # returns 12
x ** y # returns 64
x / y  # returns 1.333
x // y # returns 1
x % y # returns 1
````
** Assignment Operators

There are two types of assignment operators: the assignment operator and compound assignment operators. The assignment operator, =, is used to assign values to variables. Compound assignment operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on a variable and reassign its value at the same time. Here are the common assignment operators:

|Operator |	Example |	Description|
|:--------|:--------|-------------:|
|= |	x = 4 |	Assign 4 to x|
|+=| 	x += 4 |	Add 4 to existing value of x|
|-=| 	x -= 4 |	Subtract 4 from existing value of x|
|*=| 	x *= 4 |	Multiply existing value by 4|
|/=| 	x /= 4 |	Divide existing value by 4|
|%=| 	x %= 4 |	Modulo existing value by 4|

See examples of these operators below, with x = 4:
````
x += 4  # x is 8
x -= 4  # x is 0
x *= 4  # x is 16
x /= 4  # x is 1.0
x %= 4  # x is 0
````
** Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two variables. The result from these operators is a bool (True or False). Here are the comparison operators:

| Operator | 	Description              | 	Example |
|:---------|:--------------------------|---------:|
| ==       | 	Equal to                 |  	x == y |
| !=       | 	Not equal to             |  	x != y |
| \>       | 	Greater than             |   	x > y |
| < 	      | Less than                 |   	x < y |
| >=       | 	Greater than or equal to |  	x >= y |
| <=       | 	Less than or equal to    |  	x <= y |

See examples of these operators:
````
x = 4
y = 3
 
x == y # returns False
x != y # returns True
x > y  # returns True
x < y  # returns False
x >= y # returns True
x <= y # returns False
````
** Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine and evaluate multiple conditions. The result is a bool (True or False).

|Operator |	Description |	Example|
|:--------|:------------|---------:|
|and| 	If both statements are true, returns True| 	x > 2 and y > 1|
|or |	If one of the statements are true, returns True| 	x > 3 or y > 5|
|not |	If used, returns the reverse of the actual result| 	not(x > 10 and y > 5)|

See examples of the logical operators below:
````
x = 4
y = 3
 
x > 2 and y > 1      # returns True
x > 5 or y <= 3      # returns True
not(x > 2 and y > 1) # returns False
