# Lambda Functions

Learn about Lambda Functions in Python.

A lambda function in Python is a simple, anonymous function that is defined without a name. In this article, we’ll cover the syntax and characteristics of lambda functions.
* Lambda Function Syntax

Regular functions in Python are defined with the def keyword and a custom name. In contrast, lambda functions are defined with the lambda keyword without a name. This is the syntax to define lambda functions:
````
lambda argument(s): expression
````
A lambda function can have multiple arguments but only one expression, and is usually contained within one line of code. Let’s see an example of a lambda function:
````
add_two = lambda x: x + 2
````
In the example above, x is the argument and x + 2 is the expression. Assigning the lambda function to the variable add_two, we can call the function using add_two(). This function is still considered anonymous because it is not defined as a standard function with def:
````
add_two(5)
````
The code above would produce the following output:
````
7
````
Why Use Lambda Functions?

Lambda functions are typically used in the following scenarios:

*    When we want to write a quick function with one line
*    When we want to combine with other built-in functions such as map(), filter(), and apply() to filter for data
